A scalable, lightweight API gateway that uses token bucket rate limiting to control API access per user and per endpoint. It authenticates requests using JWT tokens and stores rate-limiting data in Redis to support distributed environments. The system is configurable in real-time using Spring Cloud Config, and an optional Admin UI allows dynamic updates to rate-limiting policies.

## Initial plan.

A lightweight web-based API gateway service that implements token bucket rate-limiting per user and per API endpoint, designed to handle high-volume traffic (1M+ requests per day) with minimal latency overhead. The system integrates with PostgreSQL for distributed state management and JWT for identity verification, features dynamic configuration updates, and includes an admin web interface for managing rate limiting policies.

Core Features:
- Token bucket rate limiting system with per-user and per-API endpoint controls
- JWT-based identity verification and user authentication
- Real-time policy management through admin web interface
- High-performance request processing with minimal latency overhead

Visual References:
Inspired by AWS API Gateway console and Cloudflare dashboard, known for their clean monitoring interfaces and intuitive policy management.
